   <p>A <b>website</b> (also written as a <b>web site</b>) is one or more <strong>web pages</strong> and related content that is<br />
     identified by a common <strong>domain name</strong> and published on at least one <strong>web server.</strong>Websites are<br />
      typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,<br />
      entertainment, or <strong>social media. Hyperlinking</strong> between web pages guides the navigation of the<br />
       site, which often starts with a <strong>home page.</strong> The <strong>most-visited</strong> sites are <strong>Google, YouTube,</strong> and<br />
        Facebook.</p>
        <p>All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <strong>World Wide Web.</strong> There are also<br />
     private websites that can only be accessed on a <strong>private network,</strong> such as a company's internal<br/>
      website for its employees. <strong>Users</strong> can access websites on a range of devices, including<br />
       <strong>desktops, laptops, tablets,</strong> and <strong>smartphones.</strong> The <strong>app</strong> used on these devices is called a web<strong></strong><br />
        browser.<strong></strong></p>
